    e "This is the Tutorial!"
    e "Here we'll go over what the game is about, and how to properly use the game system to your advantage!"
    e "The purpose of this game is to give you, the player, an insight into what a life at Hendrix can be like, with an emphasis on career development."
    e "Your goal should be to achieve a maximum in {color=#FFFF33}{u}Experience{/u}{/color} and Career Competencies, all while still maintaining a realistic balance between work and life."
    e "Through focusing on career development earlier rather than later, it should become apparent that college becomes easier and presents more opportunities."
    e "We hope that through playing you can become a bit more informed on how to take advantage of the resources offered at Hendrix and help get you thinking about what is next!"
    e "This game is very choice-oriented, so your decisions have lasting effects!"
    e "Now on how to use the game system!"

    e "At any point, you can access the game menu by right-clicking or hitting the escape button"
    e "Some of these game menu options are always available in the menu at the bottom of the screen"
    e "The game menu includes all saves of the game. Clicking on one of these slots will create a save at whatever point you are at in the game."
    e "There is no limit on the number of saves you can make, which is helpful in case you ever want to go back and pick a different decision!"
    e "If you would ever like to delete a save, hover over the save slot and hit the 'delete' key on your keyboard."
    e "Using the Load menu is much the same, but allows you to go back to any point you have previously saved."
    e "There is also a Preferences screen that holds valuable controls over the game such as text speed and volume controls."
    e "There are also helpful keyboard and mouse shortcuts, so make sure to explore the game menu!"
