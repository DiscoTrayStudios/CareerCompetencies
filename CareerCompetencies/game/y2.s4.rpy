    p "So what are y'all doing over the summer?"
    el "Well I actually talked to Dr. Maslow and am going to be working with her on her research regarding the role of music in early forming civilizations."
    p "Oh wow! That seems like a great opportunity!"
    el "Yeah I'm excited to learn more about it, and my Odyssey proposal was funded so I get to actually travel and gain in-person experience!"
    b "That's awesome! I applied to a few Chemistry REU's and should be hearing back about those pretty soon!"
    p "I'm sure you got in."
    el "Easily too. What about you [name]?"
    p "I don't actually know. I haven't really put any thought into it. I guess I figured I had more time."
    el "Well that's okay, I'm sure you still do. Is there anything in particular you would want to do?"
    p "I don't really know..."
    p "It seems like research would be a lot of fun after hearing about yours, but I'm not sure if that's for me."
    b "Well there are always internships that you could do!"
    p "Yeah that's a good point. There was that one I saw at Career Fair last year that I liked, but I don't know if they are even hiring."
    el "You should talk to Career Services, they can help you figure out what you may enjoy more and help you apply or get in touch with the right people!"
